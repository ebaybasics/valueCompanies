Some strategies for using this program:

1) Rebound Strategy:

When a sector is down heavy based off of macroeconomic events, or
based off an unrelated companies bad news, we can use this to identify the
best companies in a sector

2) Best Company:

Similar to the rebound strategy, we use this to identify best companies in sector for whatever reason we have

3) Chart Setups:

We can use finviz to identify stocks that have the ideal chart setup. Then we can use stock rover to add them to a watchlist and get relavant table data for them. This way we are getting into a company that has the best fundamentals and the best chart setup

4) Earnings:

Lots of ways to play this.

a)Buy into the best company a couple of weeks before earnings for a short trade
b)Buy options in companies not expected to do well but have a good financial histroy

5) Smallcaps and smaller:

Find the companies that the big guys dont play, less liquidity and try to have an edge
